        <div id="content">
          <p>
            The death of the 19-year-old Dalit girl from Hathras, Uttar Pradesh who had been allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men, caused an uproar on social media with several users demanding immediate justice.<br><br>
            The victim's brother claimed that no arrests were made in the first 10 days after the incident took place. After her death, the victim was forcibly cremated by the police without the consent of her family, a claim denied by the police.

            The incident took place on 14 September 2020, when the victim, a 19-year-old Dalit woman went to a farm to collect cattle fodder. The men dragged her away by dupatta around her neck injuring her spinal cord in the process. The four alleged rapists belong to the Thakur caste. The violence left her paralyzed with a severe spinal cord injury. The perpetrators had tried to strangulate the girl as she resisted their rape attempt. Her cries were heard by her mother who came to the spot to find her lying down in the farm. She was at first taken to the Chand Pa police station, where the police rejected her claims and, according to the family, humiliated them. The police registered a complaint only on 20 September. Police were able to record the victim's statement on 22 September.

            She was later shifted to the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi after her condition worsened. According to the police, the victim had been strangled with her dupatta. She died on 29 September 2020.<br><br>
            Mother of the victim said that Sandeep and Luv Kush had been harassing her and the victim for months. The autopsy noted that the victim died by "injury to the cervical spine by blunt-force trauma," and the attempt to strangle her was not the cause of death. The final post mortem report also refers to "old tears in private parts, but no rape."

            She was cremated near her home in Hathras in the dead of the night early Wednesday with her family alleging they were forced by local police to conduct the last rites.<br><br>
            “The cremation was done around 2.30-3 in the morning,” her father told PTI, a day after the young woman, grievously injured when she was allegedly gangraped by four upper caste men, gave up the battle for life.<br><br>
            In the moments preceding the cremation, the Dalit teen’s brother told PTI, “Police have forcibly taken the body and my father along with them for cremation. When my father reached Hathras (from New Delhi), he was immediately taken (to the crematorium) by the police.”

            The woman’s uncle, too, says she always preferred to stay at home. In her dying declaration, the woman had said that two of the accused men, Sandeep and Ravi, both belonging to the dominant Thakur community, had tried to assault her earlier. But she had kept quiet as she feared for the life of her father and brother.<br><br>
            “We have been punished twice,” says the victim’s younger brother Rakesh who works as a lab attendant in Noida. “Once when my sister was killed by the Thakur boys and the second time when the administration burnt her body in the dead of the night. Despite the family pleading to be allowed to see the victim’s face one last time, they were not allowed, they say. The village was turned into a police fortress and the police manhandled anyone who tried to come out of their house that night, they allege. They say they don’t even know what material was used for her funeral.

            Hathras police have arrested the four accused — Sandip, Ramu, Lavkush and Ravi — on charges of attempt to murder and gang rape[36] for gang rape, attempt to killing and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The victim's brother claimed that no arrest was made in the first 10 days of the incident.

            The family alleged that they were faced pressure from the administration. A video emerged in which the Hathras District Magistrate is seen pressuring the family into changing their statement. He could be heard saying "Don’t ruin your credibility. These media people will leave in a couple of days. Half have already left, the rest will leave in 2-3 days. We are the ones standing with you. Now it depends on you if you want to keep changing your testimony….".
            <br>
            On 3 October, the state government suspended five police officers including the Superintendent of Police.
