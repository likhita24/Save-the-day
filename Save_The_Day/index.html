        <h2 class="w3-wide">UP HATHRAS RAPE CASE</h2>
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>The reality</i></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">
          The death of the 19-year-old Dalit girl from Hathras, Uttar Pradesh
          who had been allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men, caused an
          uproar on social media with several users demanding immediate justice.
          The victim's brother claimed that no arrests were made in the first 10
          days after the incident took place. After her death, the victim was
          forcibly cremated by the police without the consent of her family, a
          claim denied by the police. <br /><br />The incident took place on 14
          September 2020, when the victim, a 19-year-old Dalit woman went to a
          farm to collect cattle fodder. The men dragged her away by dupatta
          around her neck injuring her spinal cord in the process. The four
          alleged rapists belong to the Thakur caste. The violence left her
          paralyzed with a severe spinal cord injury. The perpetrators had tried
          to strangulate the girl as she resisted their rape attempt. Her cries
          were heard by her mother who came to the spot to find her lying down
          in the farm. She was at first taken to the Chand Pa police station,
          where the police rejected her claims and, according to the family,
          humiliated them. The police registered a complaint only on 20
          September. Police were able to record the victim's statement on 22
          September.<br /><br />
          She was later shifted to the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi after her
          condition worsened. According to the police, the victim had been
          strangled with her dupatta. She died on 29 September 2020. Mother of
          the victim said that Sandeep and Luv Kush had been harassing her and
          the victim for months. The autopsy noted that the victim died by
          "injury to the cervical spine by blunt-force trauma," and the attempt
          to strangle her was not the cause of death. The final post mortem
          report also refers to "old tears in private parts, but no rape." She
          was cremated near her home in Hathras in the dead of the night early
          Wednesday with her family alleging they were forced by local police to
          conduct the last rites. “The cremation was done around 2.30-3 in the
          morning,” her father told PTI, a day after the young woman, grievously
          injured when she was allegedly gangraped by four upper caste men, gave
          up the battle for life. In the moments preceding the cremation, the
          Dalit teen’s brother told PTI, “Police have forcibly taken the body
          and my father along with them for cremation. When my father reached
          Hathras (from New Delhi), he was immediately taken (to the
          crematorium) by the police.” To show how caste superiority problem is
          effecting the lower caste people The woman’s uncle, too, says she
          always preferred to stay at home. In her dying declaration, the woman
          had said that two of the accused men, Sandeep and Ravi, both belonging
          to the dominant Thakur community, had tried to assault her earlier.
          But she had kept quiet as she feared for the life of her father and
          brother. “We have been punished twice,” says the victim’s younger
          brother Rakesh who works as a lab attendant in Noida. “Once when my
          sister was killed by the Thakur boys and the second time when the
          administration burnt her body in the dead of the night. Despite the
          family pleading to be allowed to see the victim’s face one last time,
          they were not allowed, they say. The village was turned into a police
          fortress and the police manhandled anyone who tried to come out of
          their house that night, they allege. They say they don’t even know
          what material was used for her funeral.
